# IOTAudioSwitch using Arduino Nano ESP32

## Overview
This version of the IOTAudioSwitch uses an Arduino Nano ESP32 as the microcontroller.

It is compatible with Google Home through [Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/).
## Set Up

## Notes
The Schematic and PCB include traces connecting Pin 3 to INH.
This is never actually used for "Mute" functionality.
This can be removed and ignored due to Arduino Cloud "Cloud Variable" limitations.

## To-Do/Future Plans
Finish Custom PCB

Finish "Set Up" in README
