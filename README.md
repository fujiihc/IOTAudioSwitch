# IOTAudioSwitch
Google Home Compatible Audio Input Selector

## Overview
I created this switcher because I have too many audio inputs (CD Player, Turntable, Google Chromecast Audio), and only one set of speakers.

I also had recently acquired a Google Home Nest and wanted to experiment with ESP32 Dev Boards.

I found that using Google Home to control input switching was way more convenient than having to get up and manually plug things into my speakers.

The switching is done with a [CD4052B Multiplexor](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4052b.pdf?ts=1735797913372&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com.cn%252Fproduct%252Fcn%252FCD4052B0).
## Future Plans
Finish Custom PCB

Create a version WITHOUT Arduino Cloud using different [ESP32 Microcontroller](https://www.amazon.com/DORHEA-Development-Microcontroller-NodeMCU-32S-ESP-WROOM-32/dp/B086MJGFVV/ref=pd_ci_mcx_mh_mcx_views_0_title?pd_rd_w=nsGng&content-id=amzn1.sym.bb21fc54-1dd8-448e-92bb-2ddce187f4ac%3Aamzn1.symc.40e6a10e-cbc4-4fa5-81e3-4435ff64d03b&pf_rd_p=bb21fc54-1dd8-448e-92bb-2ddce187f4ac&pf_rd_r=E53KTVRRZ11WJPA49XZE&pd_rd_wg=QMCDy&pd_rd_r=7f830703-b24a-47aa-b2a2-523e741be20f&pd_rd_i=B086MJGFVV&th=1)
